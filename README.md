# pokeRead
 
**This project aims to add voice acting to every dialogue instance in pokemon**

My kid loves pokemon but can't read. What better way to learn programming and spend my summer than building her code that will read pokemon for her? Sure, she'll be able to read well enough to play on her own in the next year. But, I'd like to share this project with the world as well. Lots of kids love pikachu. Many of them can't read. See a need, fill a need.

**Current plans:**

1. Screenshot every unique text box in the game.
 - To accomplish this, I'll write a text box capture program
 - This will need to have some kind of check for sequential text boxes for when someone says multiple things.
 - Scenario 1: A single text box
 - Scenario 2: A text box that shifts, revealing a third line, (fourth line?)
 - Scenario 3: ...
